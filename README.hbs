# libstub

libstub is a tiny UMD module that uses the global namespace to dynamically link dependencies between JS bundles.

Why? Mostly to help link together JS, independent of how it was built.

# Usage

```
  // include libstub before these files

  // file a.js, wants to export module a

  var a = {};

  libstub.provide('a', a);


  // file b.js, wants to import a and export b

  var a = libstub.consume('a');
  var b = {};

  libstub.provide('b', b);


  // file c.js, wants to import a and b.

  var a = libstub.consume('a');
  var b = libstub.consume('b');

```

There are two types of JS bundles: providers and consumers.
Providers export modules for others to use, consumers require modules to be provided to them.
A bundle can be both a provider and a consumer.
